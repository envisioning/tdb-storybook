# TDB Story book

## How to install and Run

You need `npm` to run this repo. If you're not sure you have it or not on your Mac, open terminal and type `node -v` and then `npm -v` both should return a version. If it doesn't you need to get started by installing them.

### Installing `npm` & `node`

Brew is your best friend. Go to terminal and type:

`ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`

After it has finished, type:

`brew install node`

1. Clone repo: `git clone git@github.com:envisioning/tdb-storybook.git`
2. At repo directory: `npm install`
3. `npm run storybook` will load the server
4. The URL to access will probably be: `http://localhost:9001`
